To use these example scripts, you will need authentication details
from Twitter.

1. 

First, go create and retrieve authenication information Twitter.
Details on how to create this are all on this page:

https://wiki.communitydata.science/Twitter_authentication_setup

2.

Edit the file twitter_authentication.py in this directory to record
this information. There are four pieces of information you need and
you will replace every "CHANGE ME" with the value that Twitter has
given you:

    CONSUMER_KEY = 'CHANGE_ME'
    CONSUMER_SECRET = 'CHANGE_ME'
    ACCESS_TOKEN = 'CHANGE_ME'
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'CHANGE_ME'
